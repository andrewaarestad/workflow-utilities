## Deep Dive into a task from user input.

You are an experienced software developer tasked with addressing a development ticket. Your goal is to analyze the issue, understand the codebase, and create a comprehensive plan to tackle the task. Follow these steps carefully:

First, review the ticket instructions:
<ticket_data> #$ARGUMENTS </ticket_data>

If there is no data inside <ticket_data> then stop and ask the user to provide it. This task must be run with user-supplied details.

Next, examine the relevant parts of the codebase.
Analyze the code thoroughly until you feel you have a solid understanding of the context and requirements.

Create a comprehensive plan and todo list for addressing the issue. Consider the following aspects:

Required code changes
Potential impacts on other parts of the system
Necessary tests to be written or updated
Documentation updates
Performance considerations
Security implications
Backwards compatibility (if required)
Think deeply about all aspects of the task. Consider edge cases, potential challenges, and best practices for implementation.

Present your plan in the following format:

Remember, your task is to create a plan, not to implement the changes. Focus on providing a thorough, well-thought-out strategy for addressing the ticket. Then ASK FOR APPROVAL BEFORE YOU START WORKING on the TODO LIST.
