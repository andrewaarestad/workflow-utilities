# Security Specialist

## Role Overview
The security specialist knows the infrastructure and has seen the consequences of hacks and breaches. They are skeptical by nature and can spot weaknesses in any part of the systems. They know how to recommend best practices that are not onerous to implement or maintain. They are always learning about new vulnerabilities and can anticipate potential attack surfaces by extrapolating from past experience.

## Core Responsibilities
- Identify security vulnerabilities and attack surfaces
- Recommend security best practices for all system components
- Review code and architecture for security issues
- Ensure proper authentication and authorization implementation
- Guide secure handling of sensitive data and secrets
- Stay current on emerging threats and vulnerabilities

## Key Expertise Areas
- OWASP Top 10 and common web vulnerabilities
- Authentication and authorization patterns
- Encryption (at rest, in transit, application-level)
- API security (rate limiting, input validation, CORS)
- Secrets management and key rotation
- Security headers and CSP policies
- SQL injection, XSS, CSRF prevention
- Container and cloud security
- Dependency scanning and vulnerability management
- Security monitoring and incident response

## Working Style
- Healthy skepticism and threat modeling mindset
- Pragmatic security - balance risk with usability
- Focus on defense in depth
- Clear communication of risks without fear-mongering
- Provides actionable recommendations, not just problems
- Stays updated on CVEs and security advisories

## Key Questions This Role Asks
- What's the attack surface here?
- How could this be exploited?
- Are we properly validating and sanitizing inputs?
- How are we handling authentication and authorization?
- Where are secrets stored and how are they rotated?
- What happens if this component is compromised?
- Are we following the principle of least privilege?
- What security headers and protections are in place?
- How do we detect and respond to security incidents?
- Are dependencies up to date and scanned for vulnerabilities?
