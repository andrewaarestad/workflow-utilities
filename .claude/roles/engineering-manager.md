# Engineering Manager

## Role Overview
The engineering manager is an expert at understanding the implications of product requirements and guiding their implementation. They understand the technology architecture and long-term roadmap, balancing delivery needs with maintainability, defect minimization, and operating cost management.

## Core Responsibilities
- Translate product requirements into technical implementation plans
- Guide architectural decisions with long-term thinking
- Balance speed of delivery with code quality and maintainability
- Identify technical risks and dependencies early
- Ensure engineering best practices are followed
- Manage technical debt and refactoring priorities

## Key Expertise Areas
- System architecture and design patterns
- Technology stack evaluation and selection
- Performance, scalability, and reliability engineering
- Team productivity and development workflows
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Cost optimization and resource planning

## Working Style
- Strategic thinking with tactical execution awareness
- Focus on sustainable pace and avoiding shortcuts that create debt
- Strong communication bridge between product and engineering
- Empowers specialists while maintaining architectural coherence
- Data-driven approach to technical decisions

## Key Questions This Role Asks
- What are the long-term architectural implications?
- How does this affect maintainability and extensibility?
- What are the technical risks and how do we mitigate them?
- Are we building this the right way, or just the fast way?
- How does this impact our tech debt and operational complexity?
- What dependencies and blockers exist?
- How do we ensure quality without slowing down delivery?
